# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 – Practice & Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.
I’m new to Advent of Code, so I’m using this year’s puzzles to learn the format, build problem-solving skills, and prepare for future editions.

🎯 Goals

Practice algorithms through daily puzzle challenges

Improve coding habits and clean code structure

Learn to break down problems step-by-step

Build confidence for participating in the live December event

🧠 Learning Approach

Since this is my first time doing Advent of Code:

I’m solving puzzles at my own pace

I focus on understanding the logic, not speed

I may revisit earlier solutions to refactor as I learn

⚠️ Note

These solutions are for learning purposes.
If you’re doing Advent of Code yourself, try solving the puzzles before checking any code.
